# Introduction to Rust

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on:

- Safety (memory safety, thread safety)
- Performance (zero-cost abstractions)
- Concurrency (fearless concurrency)
- Practicality (great tooling and ecosystem)

## Key Features

- No garbage collector
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Guaranteed memory safety
- Threads without data races
- Pattern matching
- Type inference
- Minimal runtime
- Efficient C bindings

## Development Environment Setup

### Installing Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Essential Tools

```bash
# Install additional components
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Install useful cargo extensions
cargo install cargo-edit cargo-watch cargo-expand
```

### IDE Setup

Recommended IDEs and editors:

1. VS Code with rust-analyzer
2. IntelliJ IDEA with Rust plugin
3. CLion with Rust plugin

## First Rust Program

Create your first program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

## Understanding Cargo

Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. Common commands:

```bash
cargo new project_name    # Create new project
cargo build              # Build project
cargo run                # Run project
cargo test              # Run tests
cargo check             # Check compilation
cargo doc --open        # Generate documentation
```
