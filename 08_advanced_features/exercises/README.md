# Advanced Features Exercises

This section contains exercises to help you practice and master advanced Rust features. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of Rust's advanced capabilities.

## Exercise 1: Safe Wrapper for Unsafe Code

Create a safe abstraction over a raw memory buffer that provides the following features:

- A fixed-size ring buffer implementation using raw pointers
- Safe public API that prevents buffer overflows
- Thread-safe operations using appropriate synchronization primitives
- Proper memory management with custom `Drop` implementation
- Comprehensive test suite including edge cases

**Requirements:**

- Use unsafe code for the internal implementation
- Implement `Send` and `Sync` traits
- Provide iterator support
- Handle error cases appropriately
- Document unsafe invariants

## Exercise 2: Custom Smart Pointer

Implement a custom smart pointer type that provides the following features:

- Reference counting with weak references
- Interior mutability
- Custom `Deref` and `DerefMut` implementations
- Thread-safe clone operations
- Type-safe downcast operations

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate atomic types for thread safety
- Implement proper drop semantics
- Handle circular references
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Include examples of common use cases

## Exercise 3: Advanced Macro System

Create a macro system that helps with database operations:

- Create macros for generating SQL queries
- Support different types of queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Handle parameter binding safely
- Provide compile-time query validation
- Generate appropriate Rust types for results

**Example Usage:**

```rust
sql_query!(SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE id = ?1, user_id);
sql_insert!(INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?1, ?2), name, age);
```

**Requirements:**

- Handle SQL injection prevention
- Support multiple database backends
- Generate appropriate error types
- Provide type safety for parameters
- Include comprehensive testing

## Exercise 4: Type-Safe Builder Pattern

Implement a type-safe builder pattern that ensures:

- Required fields must be set
- Optional fields can be omitted
- Fields can only be set once
- Type-safe validation at compile time
- Proper error handling for runtime validation

**Example Usage:**

```rust
let config = ConfigBuilder::new()
    .name("test")
    .timeout(30)
    .optional_field(Some(value))
    .build()?;
```

**Requirements:**

- Use phantom types for tracking builder state
- Implement custom error types
- Provide clear compiler errors
- Include runtime validation
- Document the type-state pattern used

## Bonus Challenge: Zero-Cost State Machine

Create a zero-cost state machine that:

- Uses the type system to enforce valid state transitions
- Compiles down to optimal machine code
- Provides compile-time guarantees
- Handles complex state transitions
- Supports async state transitions

**Requirements:**

- Use const generics where appropriate
- Implement custom derive macros
- Provide visualizations of the state machine
- Include benchmarks comparing to runtime alternatives
- Document advanced type system features used

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions will be evaluated based on:

1. Proper use of unsafe code and safety guarantees
2. Type system usage and compile-time guarantees
3. Error handling and edge cases
4. Documentation quality
5. Test coverage and benchmark results
6. Code organization and maintainability
7. Performance considerations
8. API ergonomics and usability

## Getting Started

1. Create a new directory for each exercise
2. Include a README.md with your design decisions
3. Implement the required functionality
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document unsafe code and invariants
6. Include examples of usage
7. Add benchmarks where appropriate

## Tips

- Use `cargo expand` to inspect macro expansion
- Use `cargo doc` to generate and review documentation
- Use `cargo test` with `--release` for benchmarks
- Consider using `cargo flamegraph` for performance analysis
- Review the Rust Reference for advanced feature details
