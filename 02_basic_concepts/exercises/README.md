# Basic Concepts Exercises

## ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Temperature Converter

Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius:

- Takes temperature and unit (F or C) as input
- Converts to the other unit
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Uses functions for conversion logic

**Skills practiced:**

- Variables and data types
- Functions
- Control flow
- Input handling

## ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Fibonacci Calculator

Create a program that:

- Takes a number n as input
- Calculates the nth Fibonacci number
- Implements both recursive and iterative solutions
- Compares the performance of both approaches

**Skills practiced:**

- Functions
- Loops
- Basic algorithms
- Performance comparison

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: Pattern Printer

Create a program that prints patterns:

- Takes height as input
- Prints different patterns (pyramid, diamond, etc.)
- Uses nested loops
- Implements at least 3 different patterns

Example pattern:

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

**Skills practiced:**

- Nested loops
- String manipulation
- Pattern logic
- User input

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Number Analyzer

Create a program that analyzes a list of numbers:

- Takes multiple numbers as input
- Calculates mean, median, and mode
- Finds min and max values
- Determines if numbers are prime

**Skills practiced:**

- Arrays/Vectors
- Functions
- Math operations
- Control flow

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Exercise 5: Mini Command Line Shell

Create a simple command-line shell that:

- Shows a prompt (e.g., "myshell> ")
- Supports basic commands:
  - echo: prints text
  - calc: basic calculator
  - exit: exits the shell
- Has a help command
- Keeps history of commands

**Skills practiced:**

- String parsing
- Control flow
- Functions
- Program state

## Tips

1. Start with the simpler exercises (ðŸŒŸ) and progress to more complex ones
2. Use functions to organize your code
3. Handle all possible error cases
4. Add comments explaining your logic
5. Test edge cases

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code correctness
- Error handling
- Code organization
- Documentation
- Input validation
